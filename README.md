I followed the code monkey guide on YouTube which explains how to write an A* pathfinding routine in Unity (C#).  If you run my example, it will show a grid with two points S (start) to E (end) and a purple line that runs between them. 

Build a maze using the mouse, left mouse button builds a wall, right mouse buttom removes a wall. When you stop building, approx. a second later the path will be recaculated.

Press S to move the start location
Press E to move the end location
